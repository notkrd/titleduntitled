Uses a genetic algorithm to seek out an n-gram approximation of John Ashbery's "Whatever It Is, Wherever You Are" - http://thefaraway.kavid.xyz/

Installing the dependencies and running app.py will start the flask server. Sorry if it doesn't work. I'm actually really bad at python, and web development.

Ashbery text available freely under copyright here https://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2847&context=iowareview and included as a convenience, please do not extract my transcription except for other fair use (I believe displaying n-gram approximation from a private corpus is fine, but is it legal to /read/ in its entirety here? What a bizarre, regressive, construct "intellectual property" is!)
